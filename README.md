# sky-bound
hello this is my first open source project and first try to make my game publicly available for the mass media , i would love bug fixes and more ,
also i would be happy for any kind of mods, mobile versions, and if you would please, dont try to sell this as a mass marketed game without changes the code,
plus i would be happy to talk to any person who would like to inform me about bugs.
